Purpose: Python is a dynamic typed language.
    Programming languages
        1. Static-typed languages
            - first declare the variables, and
            - then use them
                int a, float b # Declaration
                a = 10         # Initialization
                
        2. Dynamic typed languages
            - create when you need. No declaration needed
            num1 = 123
            - line or block by block based execution

    Python code -> python byte code -> python interpretor -> c compiler -> machine
    this is the reason python is a slower language when compared to base languages
